1. Create a new project in Xilinx ISE.
2. Copy "All" the files to you project. If that fails, manually create new files under your project as "verilog modules" for modules and "verilog test fixture" for testbenchs and copy the content one by one.
3. Simulate behavioural model for test benches (files that end with "_tb.v")
4. Enjoy.
